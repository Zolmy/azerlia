# Going Down and Death

## Going Down

Azerlia will use use a going down system called "Doom?".

Whenever you go down, you can choose one of the following options:

* Gain a doom stack
* Take an injury from the [injury table](https://worldbuilderblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/lingering-injuries.pdf)

Any time you go down, you will start with a number of death saving throw failures equal to your current amount of doom stacks. Doom stacks reset on a long rest.

## Death

Death and resurrection will be handled according to the system used by Matt Mercer outlined in the following picture.
