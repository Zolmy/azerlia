# Battle

* Critical hits are perfect rolls
* Drinking a health potion is a bonus action
* After rolling initiative but before the start of their first turn, a player can lower their initiative count permanently for that combat
* If you roll a nat 20 on your initiative, your first attack on your first turn will have advantage
  * Similarly, if you a roll a nat 1, that attack will have disadvantage
* If you roll a nat 1 on a melee attack, the creature you attempted to hit, if able, gets a free attack of opportunity against you
* If you forgot to do some cleanup on your turn, you may still do so during the next turn, but not later.
* You get a single "takesies backsies" per session. You can only do this up to the next turn in combat and can only happen before something else occurs that would directly make you want the "taksies backsies" (i.e. you can't decide to misty step away after a creature already decided to hit you)
