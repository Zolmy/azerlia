# Battle Homebrew

* Critical hits are perfect rolls
* Drinking a health potion is a bonus action
* After rolling initiative but before the start of their first turn, a player can lower their initiative count permanently for that combat
* If you roll a nat 20 on your initiative, your first attack on your first turn will have advantage
  * Similarly, if you a roll a nat 1, that attack will have disadvantage
