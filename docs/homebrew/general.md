# General

* You need to be proficient in the skill being rolled to able to to take the help action
* You may choose to purposely fail any check / attack you are subjected to.
* For a given task (like picking a lock), a maximum of 2 attempts can be made (either by different players or the same player) unless something truly different is being attempted.
* If you summon pixies in to conjure woodland beings, don't have them use polymorph
* No exploiting simulacrums, and no permanent simulacrums
* Pets and summons take their turn immediately after yours unless stated otherwise
* Remove curse is banned
* If you polymorph yourself and only yourself, you need not roll concentration when your polymorphed form takes damage
* Encumbrance will be "ignored." As in, I wont be annoying about carrying capacity as long as nothing crazy is attempted (i.e. carrying stuff that is obviously heavy, buying 1000+ candles, or just hoarding a marketplace in your backpack)
* You can attune to a number of magic items equal to your proficiency bonus (Artificers still gain additional attunement slots at the appropriate levels but their bonus to saves does not scale with the proficiency bonus ones)
* Attunement takes one minute, Un-attunement takes 10 minutes.
* Rations and lodging costs will be ignored so long as the cost is less than 1 gold.
* Legolas: Any ranged character can make a one-time investment of 150gp to receive unlimited mundane arrows / bolts
* Under no circumstances is advantage / disadvantage converted to a +5 / -5
