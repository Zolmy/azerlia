# Azerlia

Welcome to the world of Azerlia. A hundred years ago, the entire world of Azerlia was impacted by a wave of magical energy in an event scholars call the Infusion. As a result of the Infusion, the world's ley lines were imbued with magic, allowing the whole world to harness magical power from the earth. The cause of the Infusion is not yet understood, and is actively being investigated. Nevertheless, its occurrence led to an age of technomagical innovation. New devices and utilities brought about by joint efforts between the large factions of the Dwarves and Elves have vastly improved the lives of all throughout the world. Of course, with access to such power, some parties have employed it for more nefarious purposes.

## General Info

The world / campaign will function under 5e rules, but many things will be flavored differently.

One of the most relevant changes to you as players will be that your characters (and most if not all characters in story) will have an item called a Holo Band. This is a magical wristband powered by the magical ley lines, which will serve to ID yourself. It will also serve as your way of storing your money / making purchases. The Holo Band can also be used as a means of remote communication (Fairly large range, but not infinite. Reconsider getting message / send spells if you were planning to do so). It can also work as a navigation tool, storing a map that you can use holographically. More features of the Holo Band likely to come as we go. Importantly, although the Holo Band belongs to you, it can be taken away from your possession. As it is fueled by magic, it could also stop working should the situation merit such.
