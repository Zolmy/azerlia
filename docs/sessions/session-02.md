# Session 2

## Synopsis
After defeating the sealions, we retrieved Stardraz’s remains and gave him a burial. We attempted to identify the eyepatch, however we were missing a pearl to cast the spell and after a lucky 1d100 roll, we obtained Sally, the pearl. We Found lodging at The Wave and The Puddle and did some shopping and managed to sell some loot. We also went to the brewery, where Nyx, Freki and Luck were tortured with dangerous ale and were rewarded with 1D8 Max hp for their troubles. The next day, we went to the grand hall, where Ian announced that the infusion was brought about by a nefarious creature and asked us to deal with it. After forming a party and calling ourselves Pentagram, we received our Artifacts and sent us back to brewport.
