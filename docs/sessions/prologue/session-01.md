# Session 1

## Synopsis
We have all received a curious invitation from our most glorious benefactor to go to an adventurers feast in brewport in 2 weeks time. After chartering a ship owned by Captain Bravesail, we were sailed by Captain Callahan and his teleporting ship. The battle was easy, but the ship took some damage and we had to dock at a small island where private Stardraz disappeared after looking for resources. Our search led us to a cave at the northern side of the island. Within the cave we found a skeleton wearing private Stardraz’s eyepatch, which was giving off a magical glow when exposed to detect magic, and when interacted with, 3 sea lions emerged and attacked.
