# Session 3

## Synopsis
We received a notification on our holobands saying “Rumors have circulated that the animal and plant life in the forest has been magically altered by the infusion. Many adventurers have been reported missing after going to the forest in search of a legendary city (Zorem).” After journeying for 3 days, we came across this forest and found an unconscious Bon Samedi near a group of apple trees. He claims to have lost his party and guides us to their camp and has tales of an infinite stone wall. After investigating the wall, we found a series of marks on it dividing the area into quadrants.

After investigating, we find a magically lush apple tree. Felix and Freki consume apples cause they dumb and see themselves charmed in the middle of the night to the tree. As we wake, we follow their tracks to the tree and find them T posing by it. A fight ensues during which bon samedi sees his friends’ faces on the tree. After dispatching the tree, we made our way to the next quadrant where the road bifurcated itself into two options, the left one signaled with teeth, claws and treasure and the right one with webbed feet, poison and money. We went right and encountered Croaky, lord and savior of the grung, and her village of Grung. After 10 minutes of creative communication and a 1st level spell, we found that they would be interested in us dispatching the tricerosaurous-rex down the left path in exchange for some gems.
