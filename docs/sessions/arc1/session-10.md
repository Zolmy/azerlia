# Session 10

## Synopsis
Upon the completion of our long rest, we headed towards the gate that had denied us entry a few days before. We confronted the snarky guard with our new found status and were allowed entry, where upon we discovered that the central wall of the city was incredibly thick. We swiftly made our way to the local shops where an air of disdain towards everyone except luck permeated the air and made some light shopping and significant window shopping. With newfound determination, we then made our way towards the Serpent Pit, the city's premiere casino and a great trigger to our friend Freki. Some of us won, other Pavans and Rodrigos ruined their 401k and an uncomfortable Freki played a quaint game of pool with Nyx but we eventually made our way towards the assistant to the proprietor of this establishment, where more big "L's" ensued. After procuring 2 vials of antivenom, we made our way towards Shahmaran's chambers where a fierce fight ensued, poison gasses closing in upon us, as combat raged on and our victory seemed assured by Corvin's double smite delux Shahmaran entered in to a cocoon resulting in her metamorphosis in to a large serpent. Combat raged on with Felix's subpar positioning endangering our odds, but we triumphed and managed to extort her to the tune of 450GP from her. We then made our way towards an inn, but Nyx stayed behind to inquire as to Sanpati's interests and smitten by the Lord of Vultures, prepares for a romantic picnic with the sport team coach. some minor shopping and unsuccessful foraging ensued  (i was missing from this part on vc so if i miss something, feel free to add it or let me know and i'll edit it in) as we prepared to enter the seat of The Dark Throne.
