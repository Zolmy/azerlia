# Session 9

## Synopsis
After escaping Conundrumus' trial, we were transported to Brother Ox's arena where he denied us a long rest and we had to fight him and his partner minotaur. The battle was a tough one but after destroying the minotaur, Brother Ox revealed that it was an illusion cast by him and beckoned us out granting us his blessing to proceed towards The Metropolis of Fortune. Battered and bruised, we returned to Poun's where luck decided to annoy him and got us evicted. Having no place to turn to after a night of rest, we decided to push forward with our quest and made our way towards the Settlement of Devotion. Upon our arrival, pentagram's members were shocked to find a barren cemetery where we were attracted by roaming bats. Once the conflict with the bats was resolved, we pushed forward towards a cathedral where Yemescu, the morbed out bat priest attacked us. A particularly lethal fight ensued where luck executed Yemescu, however, the lord of bats had a trick up his sleve and reformed himself from an egg that was on his person. having all 3 signatures we needed, we proceeded to Sanpati's stadium to rest for the night and embark towards The Metropolis of Fortune.
