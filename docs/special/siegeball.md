# Siegeball

## The Game
Siegeball is a game played between two teams of five players each. Each team has a tower to defend from the other team. Players can't attack the towers directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball which can be used to knock down the towers. A team loses when their tower falls.

## The Players
Each player may take their own weapons into the arena, but must also pick a Siege Bat. Players can choose between a Thick Bat or Thin Bat which will be outlined in a later section. Switching between your weapon and Siege Bat is a free action.

Players are allowed to attack each other, but must use non-lethal force. If a player drops below 20% of their maximum HP, they are removed from the game due to injury.


## The Bats
**Thick Bat:** Simple Weapon, Two-Handed Melee Weapon, 1d8 Bludgeoning, 5ft range. Unless the batter chooses to “pass” the ball, if a thick bat was the last bat used to hit the ball, any player that takes damage from the ball must make a Constitution save to avoid being stunned until the end of their next turn, with the DC being equal to the Momentum Points of the ball.

**Thin Bat:** Simple Weapon, One-Handed Melee Weapon, 1d4 Bludgeoning, 10ft range. When you make a successful attack, you may tweak the direction you’ve sent the ball after it has traveled more than 10ft from where you hit it but before it collides with anything. You can tweak the direction by one tick of the compass (N can become NE or NW).

The modifier used for the thick bat can be either strength or dexterity, while the thin bat can use any modifier including mental ones.

## The Ball
The Siege Ball is a 1-ft diameter sphere that hovers 3 to 4-ft above the ground. The ball has a pool of Momentum Points that determine how fast it's moving, its AC, and its damage. The ball can only be damaged and receive Momentum Points by being struck by a Siege bat (though some games may allow players to use their own weapons). Magic cannot push the ball directly, but depending on the game, magical effects may be used to alter a moving ball’s course.

## Playing the Game
The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. A player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball at center field. If both players beat the ball’s AC of 8, the player with the higher attack roll decides the direction of the ball and their damage will determine the Momentum Points added. If both players miss, or if they tie their attack rolls, the ball continues to float between them. Neither tip-off player gets a reaction until the start of their first turn after tip-off. The other players begin within 10 feet and 30 feet of the ball but need not begin on their own side.

After the tip-off and subsequent reactions, players act in initiative order. A round ends when a tower is reduced to 0 HP. A game may consist of multiple agreed upon rounds, with the winner being the winner of the majority of those rounds. A game of Siege Ball can also end on a “Brutality” if one team injures more than 50% of the opposing team. The team that caused the injuries will lose for said brutality.

## Hitting the Ball
When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. The ball has an AC of 8 + its current Momentum Points. On a hit, the ball gains a number of Momentum Points equal to the damage dealt to it. The ball moves 5 feet in the chosen direction for each Momentum Point it has and will move at least five feet after any successful attack before another attack can be made on it. As it moves, the ball subtracts one Momentum Point for each 5 feet it moves until it stops.

If your attack roll against the ball totals more than 20, may may choose to “pop it up”; hitting the ball on the underside to make it travel higher, out of the reach of most players. When you choose to do a pop-up, the ball travels at an elevation of 20 feet starting from where you hit it. It remains at that elevation until it travels 20 feet from the place it was hit, at which point it drops to its normal elevation. The ball subtracts 2 momentum for every 5 feet it travels while at the 20 foot elevation.

You can also choose to “pass” the ball upon a successful hit. This reduces the AC to hit the ball by 5 for the next attacker after you successfully hit it but has no effect on the momentum.

If a feature allows you to have multiple attacks, you may take them but the ball will travel at least 5 feet between each strike attempt. You can split up your movement between each strike attempt to accomplish this.

Also, within the unique conditions of the Siege Ball game, you may use a Bonus Action on your turn to make a skill check to influence the game. Examples of this may be an Athletics check to jump within reach of a popped-up ball or a Sleight of Hand check to throw dirt in an opponents eyes to try to cause a Disadvantage. An opponent may get an opposing skill check to negate these effects at the DM's discretion. The DM also decides what effect these skill checks have on the game

## Colliding with a Player
If you are not prone, you can use your reaction to hit the ball if it is going to collide with you or one that enters your attack range at any time while it moves through your attack range. To do so, make an attack against the ball as you would normally.

If you are prone or do not want to attack a ball that is going to collide with you, you must make a Dexterity save with a DC equal to the ball’s Momentum Points. If you succeed you may use your reaction to influence the ball’s direction by one tick of the compass (N can become NE or NW) or simply step aside and avoid the ball.

If the player does not attack a ball that is going to collide with them, if their reaction attack fails and they are in the path of the ball, or if their Dexterity save fails, the ball attacks them with a bonus equal to its current Momentum Points. If this attack succeeds, the player takes non lethal damage equal to the Momentum Points of the ball and is knocked prone. The ball continues with the same momentum and trajectory. If the attack fails the ball loses half its momentum and reverses direction.

## Colliding with a Tower
If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the ball’s current Momentum Points and then stops. If both towers remain standing, play is reset with a new tip-off at the center of the field.

## Colliding with a Wall
If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an angle corresponding to its direction and continues to move until it stops.

## Holding Turns
When it gets to your turn in initiative in a Siege Ball game, you may instead choose to hold your turn. At any point before your next turn, you may use your reaction to declare your turn, which will occur immediately after the last declared movement, action, bonus action, or reaction of the current player's turn. At that point you may move up to half your movement, make one skill check, and / or make a single attack on the ball or a player. You may do this in between parts of another players' turn, which will move you to directly before them in initiative order.

## Disqualifications

* Deliberate and egregious friendly fire is prohibited. Invoking the brutality clause for your team through friendly fire results in your team's loss
* Using magic or other effects to heavily manipulate the battlefield will result in your turn being skipped and the magic or effect being negated.
