## Blackjack
**Card Game.** Each player makes their bets then rolls 2d10 publicly, The dealer also rolls 2d10 but reveals only the first number. Players and the dealer then have the option to roll as many additional dice as they see fit. However, there is a catch. You cannot exceed 21 as the sum total of your dice, or you lose the game automatically.

 If a dealer rolls a natural 21 from the start, the player(s) loses. If a player rolls 21, the dealer loses. Note that all die sides keep their face value except for the 1, which will be treated as both 1 and 11, depending on what you need at the moment of your roll.

 If you tie you get back the money you wagered. If you win you get a 1:1 payout. If you win with a blackjack (natural 21) you get a 3:2 payout. If you lose, you forfeit your wager.
