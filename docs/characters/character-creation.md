# Character Creation

**ALL HOMEBREW IS PENDING APPROVAL FROM DM**

## Basics

* Your characters will start at level 5 or whatever the current player level is

* Variant Human is banned.

* For your race, you can be any 5e, UA, or homebrew race.

* For your class, you can pick any 5e class / subclass and multiclass as you wish so long that you meet prerequisites. You may choose to use a homebrew class / subclass but you may not multiclass if you do so.

* All characters will get a free feat.

* Stats will be distributed using the point buy system.

## Equipment

* Equipment will consist of starting equipment for your level 1 class / background and some amount of starting gold depending on the current state of the campaign.
  * You will also get an amount of gold to buy non magic items during character creation only

* Your character can also pick from ONE of the following options (use DndBeyond for these):
  * 2 Common magic items (only 1 can require attunement)
  * 1 Uncommon magic item
  * 1 Rare magic item

## Backstory

* Must be flavorful in some way to allow for development.

* Must have substance (at least 3 paragraphs)

* **MUST** be written with decent grammar (I am not reading something written by a toddler).

* Please incorporate The Infusion at least a little bit. Your character could have been born before, during, or after The Infusion (doesn't matter which), but explain at least a little bit how it affects / affected them.

* I reserve the right to make you re-write / edit it

## Deities / Patrons

* All 5e deities and patrons still remain the same and your character may wish to follow any of them.

* If you want, you can create your own deity to follow, though it must make sense.

* The deity must be fleshed out just like official deities from 5e. No wishy washy gods here
