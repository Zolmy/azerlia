# Holoband Upgrades

## Holoband Upgrade: Interdimensional Storage
This upgrade to the Holoband creates an interdimensional pocket of space in which items can be stored or retrieved. The space can hold up to 200 pounds (think 6 really heavy airplane luggages), not exceeding a volume of 25 cubic feet (think large refrigerator). Living beings cannot enter this interdimensional space. Other magical containers similar to this cannot be stored in this interdimensional space.

## Holoband Upgrade: Shared Storage
While within 100 feet of another party member, you may extract items from their interdimensional storage. In order to do so, they must know what item they wish to retrieve. No window shopping.

## Holoband Upgrade: Body Bag (Unique)
One Holoband has a secondary storage module that can store and preserve a singular large or smaller corpse for an indefinite amount of time.

## Holoband Upgrade: Louisoix Pasteuriti (Unique)
