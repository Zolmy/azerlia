Once belonging to a powerful witch, Kaban has since been passed down between countless mages, but none have yet to master its potential.

## A Cook for Every Occasion
You may use Kaban as Alchemist’s supplies, Brewer’s supplies, Cook’s utensils, Herbalism kit, and Poisoner’s kit. You may also mix and match its uses, such as creating food with the effects of a healing potion. When using Kaban this way, Wisdom is your ability modifier and you are considered proficient.

## No Added Preservatives
If you don’t wish to extract a brew, Kaban is capable of preserving, remembering, and recalling any brew currently inside it in its own vial dimension. As a bonus action, you may have Kaban drain whatever it currently has inside into its vial dimension and recall something back or simply start a new brew. Kaban can store a number of brews this way equal to your proficiency bonus. Each of Kaban's brews, unless otherwise stated, have a volume equal to your proficiency bonus number of vials.

## Magical Concoction (Level 1)
Once per long rest, you may cast a spell into Kaban to create a magical brew. You may stir this brew for 10 minutes to imbue it with some witchery.

You may cast this spell from Kaban as you would normally cast a spell. When you do, the spell is cast as if it were one level higher and has one of the following effects added to it (your choice).

* Replace the spell with any spell from the Druid spell list of an equal or lower level to the original slot used
* Double the duration of the spell
* Double the area of the spell
* Double the range of the spell
* Change the area of the spell
* Change the saving throw of the spell

The brew need not be the active brew in order to cast it. You may only add one effect to the brew and Kaban may only have one magical brew at any given time and one vial's worth.

## Mirror, Mirror (Level 1?)
As an action, you can make Kaban produce a special reflective paste. You can slather this paste on any continuous vertical surface. You must slather it in a rectangular shape that is at least 4 by 8 feet and at most 6 by 10 feet. The slathered area magically turns into a mirror that only you and your allies can see. The waters inside of Kaban then become a viewport to the mirror allowing you to see the area. You can also hear sounds if their source is close enough.

Additionally, by stirring the viewport for 30 seconds you can do one of the following:

* Send a willing creature or object within 5 feet of you through Kaban to the other side
* Pull a willing creature or object within 5 feet of the mirror to Kaban

For this to work, Kaban and the mirror must be on the same plane of existence, be within 5 miles of each other, and the creature or object must be able to fit through the mirror. If you go through Kaban, you can choose to bring Kaban with you, or leave it behind. You are able to walk through the mirror without needing to stir Kaban, at which point you reappear wherever you left it after a 30 second delay.

The mirror lasts for a number of hours equal to your proficiency bonus. You can create a mirror this way once per long rest, and its teleportation property can be used 20 times, at which point it's only usable as the viewport for the remaining duration.
