Once a singular entity, Valonar and Varyou preserved balance across the Shadowfell and Feywild; however, conflict between the planes led to their separation. Though still together, Valonar and Varyou await whoever can unite them once more.

## Might of the Infusion
While wielding Valonar you gain a +2 to your spell save DC

While wielding Varyou you gain a +2 to your spell attack rolls.

Either Valonar or Varyou will function as your spellcasting focus.

When using Valonar or Varyou as daggers, they deal 1d6 + dexterity modifier radiant damage or necrotic damage respectively.

## Ethereal Form.
Valonar and Varyou reside in an ethereal plane. While attuned to them, you can summon them if you have space in your hands. (You can summon them individually or simultaneously if you wish). They cannot be stowed away except by dismissing them, and you must be holding them to dismiss them. While in combat, you can only summon or dismiss them once per round.

## Kindred Spirits
Though opposite, Valonar and Varyou have an attractive force towards each other. While both exist in the material plane, Valonar and Varyou cannot be separated by more than 100 feet. If they are separated, they will both return to their ethereal plane.

## Penumbral Dance
Once per long rest, as a bonus action, you may merge Valonar and Varyou into Lachten, a two pronged dagger. One of the prongs is a beam of holy light while the other is a wave of shadow energy. While wielding Lachten you reap the benefits of Valonar and Varyou simultaneously. Dagger attacks with Lachten deal 2d8 radiant + 2d8 necrotic + dexterity modifier force damage. When you use metamagics while wielding Lachten, you are refunded a number of sorcery points equal to half your proficiency bonus rounded down, not exceeding the total number of sorcery points spent. This merge lasts for 5 rounds.

## Delayed Spell (Metamagic)
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of one action or one bonus action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to delay the spell. At the start of your next 3 turns, you can choose to release it and have it take place. Once you release it or 3 rounds pass, you can no longer release it. On the turn you choose to release the spell, you can cast spells as you would normally.
