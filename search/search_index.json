This is a magical wristband powered by the magical ley lines, which will serve to ID yourself. It will also serve as your way of storing your money / making purchases. The Holo Band can also be used as a means of remote communication (Fairly large range, but not infinite. Reconsider getting message / send spells if you were planning to do so). It can also work as a navigation tool, storing a map that you can use holographically. More features of the Holo Band likely to come as we go. Importantly, although the Holo Band belongs to you, it can be taken away from your possession. As it is fueled by magic, it could also stop working should the situation merit such.","title":"Azerlia"},{"location":"#azerlia","text":"Welcome to the world of Azerlia.

If you have the Sunlight Sensitivity trait, you are unaffected by the trait. You are immune to magic that allows other creatures to read your thoughts or determine whether you are lying. Creatures can communicate telepathically with you only if you allow it. Dust of Sleeping \u00b6 Wondrous Item, rare Usually found in a small leather sack, this powder resembles fine, white sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, each creature that needs to breathe within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute, until the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to shake or slap the sleeper awake. You are immune to the effect. Boots of the Trail \u00b6 Wondrous Item, uncommon Until they are worn, the boots of the trail appear to be in grave disrepair. When you lace them up, the illusion fades: they are immaculate hiking boots with gold clasps and silk laces. While wearing these boots, you leave behind no tracks or other traces of your passage, and can\u2019t be tracked except by magical means. You can march for twice as long before suffering levels of exhaustion. Additionally, you can remove the boots and speak a command word (Vroom vroom) as an action to cause the boots to walk alone, leaving a false trail in any direction for up to one mile. The boots then teleport back to your feet. Cane of Youth \u00b6 Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement) While attuned to this cane, you suffer none of the frailty of old age and can\u2019t be aged magically. You can still die of old age, however. Bracelet of Animal Speech \u00b6 Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement) When you place this item on your wrist, you gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with one beast of your choice. A side effect is that you can no longer speak any other language, but can only make the noise, such as a bark or meow, of the last beast you spoke to.This effect lasts while you have the bracelet on your wrist. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for you, at the DM\u2019s discretion. Key of Opening \u00b6 Wondrous item, uncommon (6) This bronze key has a head shaped like a crown. When inserted into a non magical lock and twisted, the key expends a charge and opens the lock. The key has 6 charges when found and becomes non magical when you use the last charge. Exploding Armor \u00b6 Armor (medium, half plate), rare (requires attunement) While wearing this armor, you can use your action to cast fireball (save DC 15), centered on yourself. You take no damage from this spell. The armor cant be used this way again until the next dawn. Demonic Five Leaf Clover \u00b6 Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement) While attuned to this item you gain the following benefits: You have advantage against being charmed or frightened You have resistance to non magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage You have advantage on stealth and sleight of hand rolls Your attacks become critical hits on a 7 in addition to your normal critical hit range While your effective HP (normal + temp) is under 20% of your maximum HP you gain the following benefits: You have advantage on attack rolls and saving throws You are unaffected by difficult terrain Your movement speed is doubled You may reroll any one d20 (can only be done once per long rest) Lord's Clothes \u00b6 Wondrous item, common While wearing these lavish clothes, you have advantage on all Charisma (Deception) checks made to impersonate a noble. Philosopher\u2019s Crown \u00b6 Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing the crown, you have advantage on Arcana, History, Nature, and Religion checks. In addition, if you make one of the above skill checks and dislike the result, you can reroll the die. You must use the second result. Once you use this power, you can\u2019t use it again until you finish a long rest. Ear Cuff of the Vampire Bat \u00b6 Wondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement) While wearing this dark ceramic ear cuff, your Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing are made with advantage. In addition, whenever you make a Wisdom (Perception) check that involves hearing, you can choose to command the ear cuff to momentarily enhance your senses. When you do, its eyes flash with a piercing red glow as the bat\u2019s ceramic fangs bite down on your ear. You take 1d4+1 necrotic damage from its bite, and immediately gain a bonus to your Wisdom (Perception) check equal to the amount of necrotic damage taken in this way. This damage ignores any resistance or immunity to necrotic damage. You can decide to use this ability after you roll the d20, but before the GM determines the outcome. Clawed Slippers \u00b6 Wondrous item, uncommon These fluffy slippers are made from the pelts of rare, magical felines. While wearing these slippers, you gain a climbing speed equal to half your walking speed. Additionally, once per day, you may choose to double your walking speed until the end of your turn (no action required). Once this property has been used, it cannot be used again until the following dawn. Mirror Shield \u00b6 Armor (shield), uncommon (requires attunement) While holding this shield, ranged spell attacks have disadvantage against you. On a roll of 1, this shield reflects the spell back at the caster. Glasses of Ignorance \u00b6 Wondrous item, common (requires attunement) While attuned to these glasses you can choose one thing (creature or object) to be invisible to the wearer. These glasses can be worn by anyone, attuned or not, but only the attuned can decide what the glasses hide while the glasses are in their possession. The glasses will not grant sight into areas that normally could not be seen such as through walls, doors, containers, etc. Should these glasses get misplaced, the attuned character may speak the command work and after one minute the glasses will return to the baby seal leather case they came with. Puzzle Box \u00b6 Wondrous item, rare Though a magic item in and of itself, this cubic box often contains far more powerful and destructive items. The puzzle box can hold one cubic foot of contents, which can\u2019t be targeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors created by divination spells. Once the box is closed, it can only be opened by solving the box\u2019s puzzle. You can attempt to solve it by spending 12 hours working on the puzzle mechanism, after which you must succeed a DC 32 Intelligence check to open the box. You can close the box as an action, automatically scrambling the puzzle.","title":"Other Magic Items"},{"location":"magic_items/other/#other-magic-items","text":"","title":"Other Magic Items"},{"location":"magic_items/other/#edmunds-eye-patch","text":"Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement) While wearing this eye patch, you gain these benefits: You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

If you do not activate decaying rampage on a subsequent turn, the effect ends early. The effect ends when you would not gain any additional attacks. Any extra attacks that come from decaying rampage do an additional 1d10 force damage.","title":"Evolutionary Decay"},{"location":"magic_items/relics/wyndar/#return-strike-level-1","text":"Wyndar gains the thrown property in each of its forms.

Each team has a tower to defend from the other team. Players can't attack the towers directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball which can be used to knock down the towers. A team loses when their tower falls. The Players \u00b6 Each player may take their own weapons into the arena, but must also pick a Siege Bat. Players can choose between a Thick Bat or Thin Bat which will be outlined in a later section. Switching between your weapon and Siege Bat is a free action. Players are allowed to attack each other, but must use non-lethal force. If a player drops below 20% of their maximum HP, they are removed from the game due to injury. The Bats \u00b6 Thick Bat: Simple Weapon, Two-Handed Melee Weapon, 1d8 Bludgeoning, 5ft range. Unless the batter chooses to \u201cpass\u201d the ball, if a thick bat was the last bat used to hit the ball, any player that takes damage from the ball must make a Constitution save to avoid being stunned until the end of their next turn, with the DC being equal to the Momentum Points of the ball. Thin Bat: Simple Weapon, One-Handed Melee Weapon, 1d4 Bludgeoning, 10ft range. When you make a successful attack, you may tweak the direction you\u2019ve sent the ball after it has traveled more than 10ft from where you hit it but before it collides with anything. You can tweak the direction by one tick of the compass (N can become NE or NW). The modifier used for the thick bat can be either strength or dexterity, while the thin bat can use any modifier including mental ones. The Ball \u00b6 The Siege Ball is a 1-ft diameter sphere that hovers 3 to 4-ft above the ground. The ball has a pool of Momentum Points that determine how fast it's moving, its AC, and its damage. The ball can only be damaged and receive Momentum Points by being struck by a Siege bat (though some games may allow players to use their own weapons). Magic cannot push the ball directly, but depending on the game, magical effects may be used to alter a moving ball\u2019s course. Playing the Game \u00b6 The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. A player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball at center field. If both players beat the ball\u2019s AC of 8, the player with the higher attack roll decides the direction of the ball and their damage will determine the Momentum Points added. If both players miss, or if they tie their attack rolls, the ball continues to float between them. Neither tip-off player gets a reaction until the start of their first turn after tip-off. The other players begin within 10 feet and 30 feet of the ball but need not begin on their own side. After the tip-off and subsequent reactions, players act in initiative order. A round ends when a tower is reduced to 0 HP. A game may consist of multiple agreed upon rounds, with the winner being the winner of the majority of those rounds. A game of Siege Ball can also end on a \u201cBrutality\u201d if one team injures more than 50% of the opposing team. The team that caused the injuries will lose for said brutality. Hitting the Ball \u00b6 When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. The ball has an AC of 8 + its current Momentum Points. On a hit, the ball gains a number of Momentum Points equal to the damage dealt to it. The ball moves 5 feet in the chosen direction for each Momentum Point it has and will move at least five feet after any successful attack before another attack can be made on it. As it moves, the ball subtracts one Momentum Point for each 5 feet it moves until it stops. If your attack roll against the ball totals more than 20, may may choose to \u201cpop it up\u201d; hitting the ball on the underside to make it travel higher, out of the reach of most players. When you choose to do a pop-up, the ball travels at an elevation of 20 feet starting from where you hit it. It remains at that elevation until it travels 20 feet from the place it was hit, at which point it drops to its normal elevation. The ball subtracts 2 momentum for every 5 feet it travels while at the 20 foot elevation. You can also choose to \u201cpass\u201d the ball upon a successful hit. This reduces the AC to hit the ball by 5 for the next attacker after you successfully hit it but has no effect on the momentum. If a feature allows you to have multiple attacks, you may take them but the ball will travel at least 5 feet between each strike attempt. You can split up your movement between each strike attempt to accomplish this. Also, within the unique conditions of the Siege Ball game, you may use a Bonus Action on your turn to make a skill check to influence the game. Examples of this may be an Athletics check to jump within reach of a popped-up ball or a Sleight of Hand check to throw dirt in an opponents eyes to try to cause a Disadvantage. An opponent may get an opposing skill check to negate these effects at the DM's discretion. The DM also decides what effect these skill checks have on the game Colliding with a Player \u00b6 If you are not prone, you can use your reaction to hit the ball if it is going to collide with you or one that enters your attack range at any time while it moves through your attack range. To do so, make an attack against the ball as you would normally. If you are prone or do not want to attack a ball that is going to collide with you, you must make a Dexterity save with a DC equal to the ball\u2019s Momentum Points. If you succeed you may use your reaction to influence the ball\u2019s direction by one tick of the compass (N can become NE or NW) or simply step aside and avoid the ball. If the player does not attack a ball that is going to collide with them, if their reaction attack fails and they are in the path of the ball, or if their Dexterity save fails, the ball attacks them with a bonus equal to its current Momentum Points. If this attack succeeds, the player takes non lethal damage equal to the Momentum Points of the ball and is knocked prone. The ball continues with the same momentum and trajectory. If the attack fails the ball loses half its momentum and reverses direction. Colliding with a Tower \u00b6 If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the ball\u2019s current Momentum Points and then stops. If both towers remain standing, play is reset with a new tip-off at the center of the field. Colliding with a Wall \u00b6 If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an angle corresponding to its direction and continues to move until it stops. Holding Turns \u00b6 When it gets to your turn in initiative in a Siege Ball game, you may instead choose to hold your turn. At any point before your next turn, you may use your reaction to declare your turn, which will occur immediately after the last declared movement, action, bonus action, or reaction of the current player's turn. At that point you may move up to half your movement, make one skill check, and / or make a single attack on the ball or a player. You may do this in between parts of another players' turn, which will move you to directly before them in initiative order. Disqualifications \u00b6 Deliberate and egregious friendly fire is prohibited. Invoking the brutality clause for your team through friendly fire results in your team's loss Using magic or other effects to heavily manipulate the battlefield will result in your turn being skipped and the magic or effect being negated.","title":"Siegeball"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#siegeball","text":"","title":"Siegeball"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#the-game","text":"Siegeball is a game played between two teams of five players each.

If a player drops below 20% of their maximum HP, they are removed from the game due to injury.","title":"The Players"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#the-bats","text":"Thick Bat: Simple Weapon, Two-Handed Melee Weapon, 1d8 Bludgeoning, 5ft range. Unless the batter chooses to \u201cpass\u201d the ball, if a thick bat was the last bat used to hit the ball, any player that takes damage from the ball must make a Constitution save to avoid being stunned until the end of their next turn, with the DC being equal to the Momentum Points of the ball. Thin Bat: Simple Weapon, One-Handed Melee Weapon, 1d4 Bludgeoning, 10ft range. When you make a successful attack, you may tweak the direction you\u2019ve sent the ball after it has traveled more than 10ft from where you hit it but before it collides with anything. You can tweak the direction by one tick of the compass (N can become NE or NW). The modifier used for the thick bat can be either strength or dexterity, while the thin bat can use any modifier including mental ones.","title":"The Bats"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#the-ball","text":"The Siege Ball is a 1-ft diameter sphere that hovers 3 to 4-ft above the ground. The ball has a pool of Momentum Points that determine how fast it's moving, its AC, and its damage. The ball can only be damaged and receive Momentum Points by being struck by a Siege bat (though some games may allow players to use their own weapons). Magic cannot push the ball directly, but depending on the game, magical effects may be used to alter a moving ball\u2019s course.","title":"The Ball"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#playing-the-game","text":"The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. A player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball at center field. If both players beat the ball\u2019s AC of 8, the player with the higher attack roll decides the direction of the ball and their damage will determine the Momentum Points added. If both players miss, or if they tie their attack rolls, the ball continues to float between them. Neither tip-off player gets a reaction until the start of their first turn after tip-off. The other players begin within 10 feet and 30 feet of the ball but need not begin on their own side. After the tip-off and subsequent reactions, players act in initiative order. A round ends when a tower is reduced to 0 HP. A game may consist of multiple agreed upon rounds, with the winner being the winner of the majority of those rounds. A game of Siege Ball can also end on a \u201cBrutality\u201d if one team injures more than 50% of the opposing team. The team that caused the injuries will lose for said brutality.","title":"Playing the Game"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#hitting-the-ball","text":"When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. The ball has an AC of 8 + its current Momentum Points. On a hit, the ball gains a number of Momentum Points equal to the damage dealt to it. The ball moves 5 feet in the chosen direction for each Momentum Point it has and will move at least five feet after any successful attack before another attack can be made on it. As it moves, the ball subtracts one Momentum Point for each 5 feet it moves until it stops. If your attack roll against the ball totals more than 20, may may choose to \u201cpop it up\u201d; hitting the ball on the underside to make it travel higher, out of the reach of most players. When you choose to do a pop-up, the ball travels at an elevation of 20 feet starting from where you hit it. It remains at that elevation until it travels 20 feet from the place it was hit, at which point it drops to its normal elevation. The ball subtracts 2 momentum for every 5 feet it travels while at the 20 foot elevation. You can also choose to \u201cpass\u201d the ball upon a successful hit. This reduces the AC to hit the ball by 5 for the next attacker after you successfully hit it but has no effect on the momentum. If a feature allows you to have multiple attacks, you may take them but the ball will travel at least 5 feet between each strike attempt. You can split up your movement between each strike attempt to accomplish this. Also, within the unique conditions of the Siege Ball game, you may use a Bonus Action on your turn to make a skill check to influence the game. Examples of this may be an Athletics check to jump within reach of a popped-up ball or a Sleight of Hand check to throw dirt in an opponents eyes to try to cause a Disadvantage. An opponent may get an opposing skill check to negate these effects at the DM's discretion. The DM also decides what effect these skill checks have on the game","title":"Hitting the Ball"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#colliding-with-a-player","text":"If you are not prone, you can use your reaction to hit the ball if it is going to collide with you or one that enters your attack range at any time while it moves through your attack range. To do so, make an attack against the ball as you would normally. If you are prone or do not want to attack a ball that is going to collide with you, you must make a Dexterity save with a DC equal to the ball\u2019s Momentum Points. If you succeed you may use your reaction to influence the ball\u2019s direction by one tick of the compass (N can become NE or NW) or simply step aside and avoid the ball. If the player does not attack a ball that is going to collide with them, if their reaction attack fails and they are in the path of the ball, or if their Dexterity save fails, the ball attacks them with a bonus equal to its current Momentum Points. If this attack succeeds, the player takes non lethal damage equal to the Momentum Points of the ball and is knocked prone. The ball continues with the same momentum and trajectory. If the attack fails the ball loses half its momentum and reverses direction.","title":"Colliding with a Player"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#colliding-with-a-tower","text":"If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the ball\u2019s current Momentum Points and then stops.

At any point before your next turn, you may use your reaction to declare your turn, which will occur immediately after the last declared movement, action, bonus action, or reaction of the current player's turn. At that point you may move up to half your movement, make one skill check, and / or make a single attack on the ball or a player. You may do this in between parts of another players' turn, which will move you to directly before them in initiative order.","title":"Holding Turns"},{"location":"special/siegeball/#disqualifications","text":"Deliberate and egregious friendly fire is prohibited.
